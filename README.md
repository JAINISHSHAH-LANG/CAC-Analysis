## 📉 The Data Story

### Findings
The analysis reveals a stagnant, high-cost trend. Throughout 2024, the CAC has hovered consistently around the **229.2** mark, showing no signs of improvement. This is significantly higher than the industry target of 150.

### Business Implications
Continuing at this rate will erode profit margins and reduce the ROI of marketing spend. The gap between actual performance and the benchmark suggests that current ad spend is inefficient.

### Recommendations
To reduce CAC from 229.2 to the target of 150, we need to shift strategy from volume-based spending to efficiency-based targeting.

**Strategic Solution:**
The primary recommendation is to **optimize digital marketing channels**. This involves auditing current ad performance, cutting low-converting paid traffic, and reallocating budget towards high-retention organic avenues.
